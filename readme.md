## The aim of the thesis
Survey and comparison of Single-Source Shortest Paths algorithms

Description: 
- Implementation and analysis of classic and modern SSSP algorithms: Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Wulf-Nilsen.
- Focus mainly on negative-weight variant of the problem, when edge weights are integral and can be negative. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03456)
